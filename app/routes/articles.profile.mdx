## Preferred Working Style
I work best in environments that value clarity, efficiency, and collaboration. I thrive when team goals are well-defined, workflows are standardized, and contributions—regardless of experience level—are set up for success. I love working with people from diverse backgrounds in an inclusive, respectful culture that encourages open exchange and continuous learning. While I enjoy the synergy of in-person teamwork, I'm equally comfortable operating in remote or hybrid settings. Above all, I focus on meaningful work, clean processes, and shared wins.
