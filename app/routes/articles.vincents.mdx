## How It Started

In February 2024, I had the opportunity—thanks to QUT—to join Vincents in Brisbane as a Full Stack Engineering Intern. Alongside four of my classmates, we formed a diverse project team, each bringing different strengths to the table.

## What I Have Done

Over the past few months, I wore many hats and took on challenges that pushed me to grow:

- **Led the deployment on Azure**, setting up App Service, Blob Storage, and MySQL—all integrated with CI/CD pipelines and running with **99% uptime**.
- **Directed a 5-member Agile team**, delivering a full-featured HR maturity assessment system **two weeks ahead of schedule**.
- **Developed responsive UIs** using React and Tailwind CSS, ensuring a seamless experience across devices.
- **Built RESTful APIs** with Express.js, MySQL, and DrizzleORM, and drove high code quality with **100% unit test coverage** using Jest.
- **Created a custom admin panel** integrated with PowerBI, cutting down operational task time by **50%**.
- **Reviewed over 50 pull requests**, mentoring junior developers and maintaining a high standard of code quality.

## What I Got

This internship taught me more than just technical skills—it was a crash course in **teamwork, leadership, and building for impact**. I learned how to ship stable systems, think about usability and maintainability, and support a team through reviews and collaboration.

Most of all, I experienced the satisfaction of building tools that truly help people—and doing so in an environment that encouraged growth, curiosity, and shared success. I’m deeply thankful for the experience and excited to take everything I’ve learned into what comes next.
