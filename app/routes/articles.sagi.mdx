## How It Started

In early 2021, I joined SAGI GAMES in Wuhan as a Backend Engineer. It was my first full-time role out of university due to the lockdown in Wuhan in 2020, and I was excited to dive into the world of game backend systems—serving real players, solving real scaling challenges, and learning to build systems that just work.

## What I Have Done

During my time at SAGI GAMES, I worked across several high-impact projects:

### Genius Shooter (200,000+ MAU)

- Released globally on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/genius-shooter-monster-killer/id1484026163) & [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sagi.barrett&hl=en).
- **Improved overall throughput by 5%** by migrating API payloads from JSON to Protobuf.
- Built the backend with **Gin, Gorm, Redis, and MySQL**, achieving **100% unit test coverage** with `go test`.
- **Optimized indexing and caching**, reducing query response times to under **50 ms**.
- Developed a **Makefile-powered CI/CD pipeline**, cutting release time by **80%** through automated containerization.

### Mini-Games Platform (500,000+ MAU, Totally)

- Consolidated logic for **100+ mini-games** into a unified codebase, boosting release cycle speed by **10%**.
- Re-architected the backend with **Flask, SQLAlchemy, Redis, and MySQL**, splitting a monolithic app into **6 microservices**.

### Infrastructure & Tooling

- **Migrated services from EC2 to ECS Fargate**, enabling elastic scaling and reducing infrastructure costs by **25%**.
- Built a **React/Flask-based HR recruitment system**, saving the HR team over **15 hours per month**.
- Maintained a **Vue/Flask admin panel** with improved validation that **cut config time by 30%**.
- Developed the **company website and game pages** using Webpack and Bootstrap, with automated CDN deployment.

## What I Got

This role was foundational for me. It sharpened my backend engineering skills and gave me hands-on experience with performance tuning, cloud migration, microservices, and CI/CD. I learned how to think about systems at scale and how small changes—like optimizing a query or tightening a release pipeline—can have a huge impact.

Beyond code, I gained confidence working in a fast-paced game development environment, collaborating across teams, and supporting real users across the globe. It was an incredible ride, and it laid the groundwork for the engineer I am today.
